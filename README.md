# Connection to JETSON

## Connecting with Router
It is easier to create a network with a router because the ip is given by DHCP. Connect JETSON and host computer to router. I've been using the USV router. 
The ip for that router is `192.168.0.1`. If using another router ip should be in router. This ip leads to the configuration page of the router, it can be accesed
with any browser.

## Connecting directly to Host Computer
